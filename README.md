# websvr

I've been messing around with Rust while at the beach and going through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-03-graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup.html) Book. This is a simple webserver implementation provided as a tutorial. Maybe you'll see some more Rust projects alongisde this one, who knows.
